# File servers
Serving file is often an essential feature of a server. In the Linux world two
popular systems are used, samba and nfs. It depends on the use case which 
system is more common. In a Linux-only environment nfs is a good choice. If
you want to serve files for Microsoft Windows systems samba is an easy way to
go.
