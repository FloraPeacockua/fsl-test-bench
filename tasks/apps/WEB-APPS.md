## DVWA
Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn
vulnerable. The main goals of DVWA are to be an aid for security professionals
to test their skills and tools. It should help web developers to better
understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students
to teach/learn web application security in a class. 

## bWAPP
Or a buggy web application is a web application build to allow security
enthusiasts, students, and developers to better secure web applications.
bWAPP prepares to conduct successful penetration testing and ethical hacking
projects. 

## SQLI Labs
A platform to learn about SQL injection (SQLI). The labs are covering a wide
range of injections (Union select, blind, update query, insert query, etc.). 

## SQLol
A configurable SQL injection environment. SQLol allows to exploit SQL
injection flaws, but furthermore allows a large amount of control over the
manifestation of the flaw.

## OWASP Hackademic Challenges Project
The OWASP Hackademic Challenges is an open source project that can be used to
test and improve one's knowledge of web application security.

## XSSeducation
XSSeducation is a set of Cross Site Scripting vulnerable PHP pages for learning
about XSS Vulnerabilities.
