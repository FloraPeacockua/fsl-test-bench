DVWA
----
Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn
vulnerable. The main goals of DVWA are to be an aid for security professionals
to test their skills and tools. It should help web developers to better
understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students
to teach/learn web application security in a class. 

bWAPP
-----
Or a buggy web application is a web application build to allow security
enthusiasts, students, and developers to better secure web applications.
bWAPP prepares to conduct successful penetration testing and ethical hacking
projects. 

SQLI Labs
---------
A platform to learn about SQL injection (SQLI). The labs are covering a wide
range of injections (Union select, blind, update query, insert query, etc.). 

MCIR
----
The Magical Code Injection Rainbow (MCIR) is a framework for building
configurable vulnerability testbeds. It includes cryptomg, shellol, sqlol,
xmlmao, and xssmh.

OWASP Hackademic Challenges Project
-----------------------------------
The OWASP Hackademic Challenges is an open source project that can be used to
test and improve one's knowledge of web application security.

XSSeducation
------------
XSSeducation is a set of Cross Site Scripting vulnerable PHP pages for learning
about XSS Vulnerabilities.

Bricks
------
Bricks is built on PHP and MySQ and serves as a web application security
learning platform. It has strong focuses on variations of commonly seen
application security issues. All 'Bricks' has some sort of security issue and
those can be leveraged.
