Installation & Setup
====================

To setup a Test bench on a host in your network you need at least two systems
either a physical machine with a virtual machine and a bridged network
connection or two physical systems (one as system to perform the the actions
and one which will serve as Test bench). In the latter case a working network
is needed too, incl. DHCP/DNS. For the setup process a connection to the
internet is mandatory because some files need to be downloaded. This guide
will use the definitions from below for the two system to make it clear which
one is involved:
